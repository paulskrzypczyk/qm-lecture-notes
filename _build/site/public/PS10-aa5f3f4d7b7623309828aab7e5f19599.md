## Infinite Square Well

1. In this question we will find the momentum wavefunctions associated to the energy eigenstates of the infinite square well. Recall that the spatial wavefunctions of the energy eigenstates are given by
    \begin{equation*}
        u_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \sin \left(\frac{n \pi x}{a}\right), 
    \end{equation*}
    for $0 \leq x \leq a$, and $u_n(x) = 0$ otherwise.
    1. Show that the momentum wavefunction $\tilde{u}_n(p)$ associated to $u_n(x)$ is given by
		\begin{equation*}
         \tilde{u}_n(p) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi a}{\hbar}}\frac{n}{n^2 \pi^2 - a^2p^2/\hbar^2}(1-(-1)^ne^{-iap/\hbar}).
         \end{equation*}
		```{note} Hint
            It is useful to recall that $\sin \theta = (e^{i\theta}-e^{-i\theta})/2i$ and that $e^{i n\pi} = e^{-i n\pi} = (-1)^n$.
        ```

	2. For $n = 1$ and $n = 2$, i.e. for the ground state and first excited state, sketch the real and imaginary parts of the momentum wavefunctions, and also the momentum probability density.
	
2. Consider a particle confined inside an infinite square well of width $a$. The wavefunction of the particle is 
	\begin{equation*}
		\Psi(x) = \begin{cases}
			\sqrt{\frac{3}{a^3}}x&  \text{if } 0 \leq x < a, \\
			0  &\text{otherwise. }
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
	1. Sketch the wavefunction $\Psi(x)$ and confirm that it is normalised. 

	In this Problem we would like to write this wavefunction as a superposition of the energy eigenstates of the infinite square well. That is, we would like to write $\Psi(x)$ as
	$$ \Psi(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n u_n(x),$$
	where 
	$ u_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}\sin \left(\frac{n\pi x}{a}\right)$ for $0 \leq x \leq a$, and $u_n(x) = 0$ otherwise. 

	2. Show that the amplitude $c_n$ is given by
		$$ c_n = - \frac{\sqrt{6} (-1)^n}{n\pi}.$$
		```{note} Hint
        1. You will need to integrate by parts
        2. Note that $\cos(n\pi) = (-1)^n$.
        ```

	3. What are the probabilities for the particle to have the energies $E_1$, $E_2$ and $E_3$, where $E_n = \hbar^2\pi^2n^2/2ma^2$ are the energy levels of the infinite square well? 

		\item What is the probability for the particle to have energy at least $E_4$?
	\end{enumerate}
\newpage
	\item In this question we will consider an approximation to the wavefunction from Problem 10.1, and study its evolution. One way to approximate a wavefunction is to consider only the amplitudes which have largest modulus. Therefore, consider the following initial wavefunction for a particle,
	$$ \Psi(x,0) = A \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\pi}\left(u_1(x) - \frac{1}{2}u_2(x) + \frac{1}{3}u_3(x) \right),$$
	where $A$ is a normalisation constant.  
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find the normalisation constant $A$.  
		
		\noindent\hint{ It is much easier \textbf{not} to use the explicit form of $u_n(x)$, but rather to use the normalisation and orthogonality properties of the energy eigenstates, to carry out this calculation.}

		\item Make a sketch of the wavefunction $\Psi(x,0)$.
	
		\item Write down $\Psi(x,t)$, the wavefunction of the particle at time $t$. 

		\item Show that the wavefunction of the particle returns to the form it has at $t = 0$ whenever the time is a multiple of the period $T = 2\pi/\omega$, where
		$$ \omega = \frac{\hbar \pi^2}{2 M a^2}.$$
		That is, show that $\Psi(x,mT) = \Psi(x,0)$, where $m$ is an integer. 	



1. Consider a particle whose wavefunction is the Gaussian wavepacket from [](#example-gaussian-1) in the lecture notes,
    \begin{equation*} \Psi(x) = \left(\frac{1}{a\sqrt{2\pi}}\right)^{1/2} e^{-x^2/4a^2}e^{ip_0 x/\hbar}, 
    \end{equation*} 
    where $a$ and $p_0$ are arbitrary real constants.  
    1. Write down the quantum mechanical prediction for the average momentum, $\langle p \rangle$, in terms of the momentum operator $\hat{P}$. 
    1. Evaluate this expression for the Gaussian wavepacket $\Psi(x)$. 
        ```{note} Hint
        You may want to use the following results for Gaussian integrals in order to help carry out this calculation:
        \begin{equation*}
	        \infint e^{-b y^2}dy &= \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{b}}, & \infint y e^{-b y^2}dy &= 0.
	    \end{equation*}
        ```

    In Example 5.1 we showed that the associated momentum wavefunction of the particle is
    \begin{equation*} 	
    \tilde{\Psi}(p) = \left(\frac{2a^2}{\pi \hbar^2}\right)^{1/4} e^{-a^2(p-p_0)^2/\hbar^2},
    \end{equation*}


	3. Write down the definition of the average momentum $\langle p \rangle$ in terms of $P(p)$, the probability density for the particle to have momentum $p$. 
	4. Evaluate this expression for the probability density $P(p) = |\tilde{\Psi}(p)|^2$ associated to the Gaussian wavepacket.  
        ```{note} Hint
		You may again want to make use of the above results for Gaussian integrals.
        ```

	5. Do your answers to part 2. and 4. agree with each other?
	

2. Consider a particle whose wavefunction is the Gaussian wavepacket $\Psi(x)$ from Problem 9.1. 
    1. Calculate the action of the momentum operator followed by the position operator acting on this wavefunction, that is, calculate $\hat{X}\hat{P}\Psi(x)$. 

    1. Calculate the action of the position operator followed by the momentum operator acting on this wavefunction, that is, calculate $\hat{P}\hat{X}\Psi(x)$. 

	1. Write down the difference between applying the operators in the two different orders, that is, write down $\hat{X}\hat{P}\Psi(x) - \hat{P}\hat{X}\Psi(x)$.

	1. Does your result to part (c) confirm the **canonical commutation relation**?

## The Uncertainty Principle

3. Consider a particle with spatial wavefunction $\Psi(x,t_0)$ and momentum wavefunction $\tilde{\Psi}(p,t_0)$ from Problem 8.3:
	\begin{equation*}
		\Psi(x,t_0) &= \begin{cases}
			\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}(1-x^2)&  \text{if } |x| \leq 1, \\
			0  &\text{otherwise, }
		\end{cases}\\ \tilde{\Psi}(p,t_0) &= \sqrt{\frac{15 \hbar^3}{2\pi}}\left(\frac{\hbar \sin (p/\hbar)}{p^3} - \frac{\cos(p/\hbar)}{p^2}\right).
	\end{equation*}
	1. Show that both $\Psi(x,t_0)$ and $\tilde{\Psi}(p,t_0)$ are even functions. 
		```{note} Hint
            Recall that an even function is one such that $f(-y) = f(y)$.
        ```
	1. Explain why this implies that both the average position and average momentum are zero,
		\begin{equation*}
		\langle x \rangle &= 0,& \langle p \rangle &= 0.
		\end{equation*}
	1. Calculate the average square position of the particle, $\langle x^2 \rangle$, and the standard deviation, $\Delta x~=~\sqrt{\langle x^2\rangle - \langle x \rangle^2}$.


    It can be shown that the average square momentum of the particle is 
    \begin{equation*} 
        \langle p^2 \rangle = \frac{5\hbar^2}{2}.
    \end{equation*}
	4. Calculate the standard deviation in the momentum of the particle, $\Delta p = \sqrt{\langle p^2 \rangle - \langle p \rangle^2}$.

	5. Show that the particle satisfies the **Uncertainty Principle**. How close is the particle to saturating the bound of the uncertainty principle?
