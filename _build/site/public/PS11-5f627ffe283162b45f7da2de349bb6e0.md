## Finite Square Well

1. In this question we will find the equation for the energy eigenvalues for the **symmetric** finite square well, i.e. the potential well such that
	\begin{equation*} V(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } -\frac{a}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{a}{2}, \\
		V_0 & \text{otherwise,}
	\end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
	where $V_0$ specifies the height of the well, and $a$ the width. We will denote the region to the left of the well, such that $x < -a/2$ by region I, the region inside the well, such that $-a/2 \leq x \leq a/2$ by region II, and the region to the right of the well, such that $x > a/2$ by region III. 
	
	We will only be interested in **bound** states, such that $E < V_0$. 
	
	Since the potential is now **symmetric** about the origin, it is an **even** function. This means that that the energy eigenstates will be alternatively **even** and **odd** functions. In this question we will only be interested in the energy eigenvalues of the **even** solutions, i.e. every other energy, starting with the ground state.

	1. Write down the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation in region I, and solve it, to show that the permissible solution in this region is
		\begin{equation*}
        u_\rI(x) = Ae^{\zeta x},
        \end{equation*} 
		where $\zeta = \sqrt{2M(V_0 - E)}/\hbar$ and $A$ is a constant.

	2. Write down the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation in region II, and solve it, to show that an **even** solution in this region is
		\begin{equation*}
        u_\rII(x) = C\cos kx,
        \end{equation*} 
		where $k = \sqrt{2ME}/\hbar$ and $C$ is a constant.

	3. Using the fact that the wavefunction is **even**, show that the solution in region III is
		\begin{equation*}
        u_\rIII(x) = Ae^{-\zeta x}.
        \end{equation*} 
		
	4. Use the continuity of the wavefunction and its first derivative at the boundary between regions I and II to show that the following equation must hold, which is the **quantisation condition**
	    \begin{equation*}
    \zeta = k \tan \frac{ka}{2}.
        \end{equation*}

	5. Defining $k_0 = \sqrt{2MV_0}/\hbar$, such that $\zeta^2 = k_0^2 - k^2$, find a suitable pair of functions to sketch, such that the intersection points of these functions give the allowed values of $k$. Make a sketch, and indicate the intersection points. 

## Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

2.  In this question we will derive the dimensionless form of the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for the quantum harmonic oscillator.
	1. The three dimensionful quantities for the quantum harmonic are the mass of the particle $M$, the angular frequency $\omega$ (which specifies the spring constant $k = M\omega^2$), and $\hbar$. Write down the dimensions of each of these quantities.

	2. Find a combination of these quantities that has the dimension of length.  That is, let 
		\begin{equation*} a = M^\alpha \omega^\beta \hbar^\gamma,
        \end{equation*}
		and find the exponents $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ that give $a$ the dimension of length. 

	3. Show that the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for the harmonic oscillator becomes
		$$ \frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = (y^2-\mathcal{E})u(y),$$ 
		upon the substitutions $x = ya$ and $E = \frac{1}{2}\hbar \omega \mathcal{E}$.
		
		\noindent \hint{Recall from the chain rule that $\frac{du}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dx}\frac{du}{dy}$, $\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2}\frac{du}{dy} + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2\frac{d^2u}{dy^2}$, and note that we treat $u$ as a function of $y$ after making the substitution $x = ay$, and write it as $u(y)$.}
	\end{enumerate}
	\bigskip
	\item In this question we will normalise the ground state and the first excited state of the quantum harmonic oscillator. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Normalise the ground state wavefunction $$ u_0(x) = A_0e^{-x^2/2a^2}.$$
		\item Normalise the first excited state wavefunction $$ u_1(x) = A_1 \left(\frac{x}{a}\right) e^{-x^2/2a^2}.$$ 
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\hint{You may use the following result for Gaussian integrals in order to carry out this calculation:
		\begin{align*}
			\infint e^{-b y^2}dy &= \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{b}}, & \infint y^2 e^{-b y^2}dy = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{b^3}},
		\end{align*}
		where $b$ is real and positive. }
\bigskip
	\item In this question we will find the third excited state of the quantum harmonic oscillator. As in the notes, we will make a guess that the wavefunction is of the form $$ u_3(y) = v(y)e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}. $$
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that the function $$ v(y) = A_3y(y-c)(y+c), $$ where $A_3$ and $c$ are constants, is an odd function with 3 nodes (i.e.~is zero precisely 3 times). This shows that it is a good guess for the form of $v(y)$ for the third excited state.

		\item Show that
		$$ \frac{d^2 u_3}{dy^2} = A_3\Big(y^5 - (7+c^2)y^3 + (6 + 3c^2)y \Big)e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}.$$

		\item Using the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation from Problem 2, and equating the coefficients of the different powers of $y$, show that the following pair of equations must hold
		\begin{align*}
			-(7+c^2) &= - (\mathcal{E} + c^2),& 6+3c^2 &= \mathcal{E}c^2.
		\end{align*}
		\item Solve the equations from part (c) for $\mathcal{E}$ and $c$ to show that the third excited state of the quantum harmonic oscillator is
		$$ u_3(x) = A_3\frac{x}{a}\left(\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{3}{2}\right)e^{-x^2/2a^2},$$
		with corresponding energy eigenvalue
		$$ E_3 = \frac{7}{2}\hbar \omega,$$
		after making appropriate substitutions for $y$ and $\mathcal{E}$.
