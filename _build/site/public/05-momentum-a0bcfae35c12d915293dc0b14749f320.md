In the previous section we determined how free particles behave according to quantum mechanics. We saw that the stationary states of a free particle are unnormalisable, but by carefully constructing superpositions of stationary states it is possible to find normalised wavefunctions. In this section we will take a closer look at the significance of these superpositions, which will provide a way to define **momentum** in quantum mechanics. 

Much like a particle doesn't have a well-defined position, but is rather in a superposition of locations, in quantum mechanics **particles do not have well-defined momenta**, but rather have a **superposition** of momenta. We will see below that we can define **probability amplitudes** for a particle to have a momentum $p$, and that this amplitude is specified by a **momentum wavefunction**.

### Plane waves and De Broglie
In the previous section, we found that the  separable solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle were given by [](#e-psik), i.e. 
\begin{equation}
\Psi_k(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-i\hbar k^2 t/2M} e^{ikx} ,
\end{equation}
where $E = \hbar^2 k^2 / 2M$ was the constant which appeared in the TISE. Our starting point will be to take a closer look at these solutions, to better understand what they represent. 


Similarly to how it was instructive to look at the angular frequency of the temporal part of a stationary state (see Sec.~\ref{s:time eq}) it will also be instructive to look at the **wavelength** of the spatial part of these wavefunctions. In particular, for the function $e^{ikx}$ we immediately see that the wavelength is $\lambda = 2\pi/k$ since
\begin{equation}
e^{ik(x + \lambda)} = e^{i(kx + 2\pi)} = e^{ikx}
\end{equation}
which means that $k$ is in fact the **wave number** of the wave (which is the reason why we chose to call it $k$ in the first place). Such functions are in fact **complex plane waves**. The real and imaginary parts of such functions oscillate sinusoidally with wavelength $\lambda = 2\pi/k$.

We can now invoke de Broglie's hypothesis [](#e-de-Broglie), but **in reverse**. Whereas de Broglie's hypothesis is that if a particle has a definite momentum $p$, then it has definite wavelength $\lambda = h/p$ and therefore definite wavenumber $k = 2\pi/\lambda = p/\hbar$, we can go in reverse, and say that **if a wavefunction has a definite wavenumber $k$, then it has a definite momentum $p = \hbar k$**.

We thus tentatively view the stationary wavefunctions $\Psi_k(x,t)$ in [](#e-psik) as **corresponding to particles with momentum $p = \hbar k$**, since they are states with a definite wavelength $\lambda = 2\pi/k$. 


A first indication that this is a good idea is to recall the relation between $E$ and $k$ from [](#e-k-versus-E). We see that, in conjunction with the de Broglie relation $p = \hbar k$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2M} = \frac{p^2}{2M},
\end{equation}
which shows that the identification of $\hbar k$ with the momentum fits together nicely with the identification of $E$ in the TISE with the energy. In particular, if $E$ is the energy, and $p$ is the momentum, this equation is precisely the equation defining the **kinetic** energy of a particle. 


### Superpositions of momenta
In the previous section we saw that the wavefunctions $\Psi_k(x,t)$ for a free particle are unnormalisable, and hence are inadmissible states for a particle. Now that these wavefunctions are seen to correspond to states of definite momentum, we arrive at the absolutely fundamental conclusion that **it is impossible for a particle to have a definite momentum in quantum mechanics**. 

In order to get around this problem, we realised that a superposition of the states $\Psi_k(x,t)$ could in fact form a normalised wavefunction. We now see that such superpositions correspond to **superpositions of momenta**. In particular, when we introduced the superposition principle, we stressed that if the different wavefunctions being superposed have **different physical properties**, then it is natural to say that in the superposed wavefunction this **property is in superposition**. This is exactly what we are doing here, but now for the momentum of a particle. 

(s-momentum-wavefunction)=
### The momentum wavefunction
We will now show how to go one step further, and describe the superposition of momentum **quantitatively** by introducing the idea of a **probability density** for momentum and an associated **probability amplitude**, in direct analogy to the way we defined these quantities for the position of the particle. In particular, previously we said that a particle with wavefunction $\Psi(x,t_0)$ is in a superposition of locations, with the probability amplitude at the position $x$ at time $t_0$ given by $\Psi(x,t_0)$, and the probability density given by $P(x,t_0) = |\Psi(x,t_0)|^2$. 

Our goal is to determine analogous quantities for momentum, namely a **momentum wavefunction $\tilde{\Psi}(p,t_0)$** such that the probability amplitude for the particle to have momentum $p$ at time $t_0$ is $\tilde{\Psi}(p,t_0)$, and the probability density for momentum is $|\tilde{\Psi}(p,t_0)|^2$. 

To guide us, let us look once again at the expression [](#e-inverse-1) from the previous section, for a free particle at $t = 0$ , namely
\begin{equation}
\Psi(x,0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\infint  c(k) e^{ikx} dk,
\end{equation}
which we showed was a normalised wavefunction as long as 
\begin{equation}
\infint  |c(k)|^2dk= 1.
\end{equation}
If we substitute the de Broglie relation $p = \hbar k$ into this condition, taking care that $dp = \hbar dk$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\infint  \frac{1}{\hbar}|c(p/\hbar)|^2 dp= 1.
\end{equation}
This suggests that we should identify the integrand $\frac{1}{\hbar}|c(p/\hbar)|^2$ with $P(p,0)$, the **probability density for momentum** at $t = 0$. Going one step further, it also suggests that we identify $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar}}c(p/\hbar)$ with $\tilde{\Psi}(p,0)$, the **momentum wavefunction** at $t = 0$, since the modulus square of this function is precisely $P(p,0)$. 

Having the momentum wavefunction and probability density defined in terms of $c(p/\hbar)$ is however not fully satisfactory, and hides the final message, since ultimately we would like to have them expressed in terms of the wavefunction $\Psi(x,0)$ itself, which, after all, is a complete description of the state of the particle at $t = 0$. We can achieve this by using the relation [](#e-c from psi) from the previous section. In particular, we find
```{math}
\tilde{\Psi}(p,0) =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \hbar}}\infint  \Psi(x,0) e^{-ipx/\hbar}dx.
```

This form also suggests how to extend the definition from $t = 0$ to all times $t$: We simply replace $\Psi(x,0)$ on the right-hand side, with $\Psi(x,t)$, arriving at
````{card}
\begin{equation}\label{e-psip}
\tilde{\Psi}(p,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \hbar}}\infint  \Psi(x,t) e^{-ipx/\hbar}dx.
\end{equation}
````
This is the **momentum wavefunction** of a particle. We see that at any given time $t_0$ it is **completely specified** by the wavefunction $\Psi(x,t_0)$ at the same time. That is, the momentum wavefunction is not independent of the wavefunction, but is a function of it. This was to be expected, since the wavefunction is a **complete specification** of the state of the particle at any given time. What we see is that a (rather complicated) function of the wavefunction specifies the **probability amplitude** and the corresponding probability density for the particle to have momentum $p$. 

We have thus achieved a **very important goal** -- we now understand, in full generality, **how momentum is specified in quantum mechanics**. 

#### The momentum wavefunction as a different representation of the state
Interestingly, **the momentum wavefunction is also a complete specification of the state of a particle**. To see this, consider, just as we did in [](#s-arb-init-wf), multiplying both sides of [](#e-psip) by $e^{ipx'/\hbar}$ and integrating over $p$, to obtain
```{math}
\infint \tilde{\Psi}(p,t) e^{ipx'/\hbar}dp  &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \hbar}}\infint dp \infint dx \Psi(x,t) e^{-ipx/\hbar}e^{ipx'/\hbar},\\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \hbar}}\infint \Psi(x,t) 2\pi \delta\left(\tfrac{x'-x}{\hbar}\right)dx , \\
&= \sqrt{2\pi \hbar}\Psi(x',t),
```
where we used the definition of the Dirac Delta function [](#e-delta) to arrive at the second line, and the change of scale property [](#e-delta-scale), i.e. that $\delta\left(\tfrac{x'-x}{\hbar}\right) = \hbar \delta(x'-x)$,
to arrive at the third line. This shows that, after replacing everywhere $x'$ with $x$, that
````{card}
\begin{equation}\label{e-psix in psip}
\Psi(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}} \infint  \tilde{\Psi}(p,t) e^{ipx/\hbar}dp.
\end{equation}
````
Thus, if the momentum wavefunction is known at a time $t_0$, then it is possible to recover the spatial wavefunction $\Psi(x,t_0)$ at that time. **Both wavefunctions are complete specifications of the state of a particle**. We say that they constitute two different **representations** of the state. 

In many problems we are interested primarily in the position of the particle, hence the wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$ is a more **useful** representation. If however we care more about the momentum of the particle, which happens for instance often in **scattering experiments in particle physics**, or often in **condensed matter physics**, then it is more useful to work with the momentum wavefunction $\tilde{\Psi}(p,t)$. You will see this later in your physics education. 

### Gaussian wavepacket
We end this section by returning to our example of the Gaussian wavepacket of a free particle from [](#s-Gaussian), to look at it's momentum. 

````{prf:example} Gaussian wavepacket of a free particle
:label: example-gaussian-momentum
	
Recall that in [](#example-gaussian-1) we considered the following superposition
	
\begin{equation}\label{e-gaussian-c(k)}
	c(k) = \left(\frac{2a^2}{\pi}\right)^{1/4}e^{-a^2(k-k_0)^2}.
\end{equation}
which was a Gaussian function, centred at $k = k_0$.  We saw that it lead to the wavefunction
\begin{equation}
	\Psi(x,0) = \left(\frac{1}{a\sqrt{2\pi}}\right)^{1/2} e^{-x^2/4a^2}e^{ik_0 x}.
\end{equation}
	
Using the identity $\tilde{\Psi}(p,0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar}}c(p/\hbar)$, we see that the corresponding momentum wavefunction is
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\Psi}(p,0) = \left(\frac{2a^2}{\pi \hbar^2}\right)^{1/4} e^{-a^2(p-p_0)^2/\hbar^2},
\end{equation}
where we have defined $p_0 = \hbar k_0$. In [](#ex-gaussian-mom-t) below, we show that at later times the momentum wavefunction is
\begin{equation}\label{e-mom-wf-t-gaussian}
	\tilde{\Psi}(p,t) = \left(\frac{2a^2}{\pi \hbar^2}\right)^{1/4} e^{-a^2(p-p_0)^2/\hbar^2} e^{-ip^2t/2M\hbar},
\end{equation}
i.e. the wavefunction at later times is multiplied by the **phase factor** $e^{-ip^2t/2M\hbar}$. We say that it **accumulates a phase in time**. In a figure
```{image} ./Pictures/gaussian-momentum-phase.png
:alt: 
:width: 500px
:align: center
```
The probability density for momentum at time $t$, $P(p,t) = |\tilde{\Psi}(p,t)|^2$, is therefore
\begin{equation}
		P(p,t) = \left(\frac{2a^2}{\pi \hbar^2}\right)^{1/2} e^{-2a^2(p-p_0)^2/\hbar^2}.
	\end{equation}
	Notably this is **independent of time** -- the probability density of the momentum of the particle does not change in time for a free particle. This is the quantum mechanical manifestation of **conservation of momentum** that we expect to hold for a free particle from classical physics.
	
	Moreover, we see that, just like the probability density in space $P(x,t)$, the probability density for momentum is also a **normal distribution**, with mean and standard deviation
	\begin{align}
	\langle p(t) \rangle &= p_0, \\
	\Delta p(t) &=~\frac{\hbar}{2a}.
	\end{align}
	
	This now **explains** why the wavepacket **spreads** in time. The particle has a **superposition of momenta** at all times. The evolution of the particle is the **superposition** of the different evolutions, one for each momentum. If the particle has larger momentum, then it travels further in a given time, and if it has small momentum, it travels less. It is the superposition of the initial wavepacket travelling all of the different distances that leads to a wider Gaussian wavepacket at later times.

\begin{exercise}[Momentum wavefunction of a Gaussian wavepacket at time $t$] \label{ex:gaussian mom t} In this exercise, we will derive the momentum wavefunction $\tilde{\Psi}(p,t)$ of a free particle at time $t$, and apply it to the Gaussian wavepacket from Example \ref{example-gaussian 1}.
	 \begin{enumerate}[(a)] 
	 	\item By making the substitution $k = p/\hbar$, show that expression for the wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$ at time $t$ for a free particle, as given in [](#e-wavepacket),  can be rewritten as
	 	$$ \Psi(x,t) = \frac{1}{\hbar\sqrt{2\pi}}\infint c(p/\hbar) e^{-i p^2 t/2M\hbar} e^{ipx/\hbar} dp. $$
	 	\item By appealing to the relationship between $\Psi(x,t)$ and $\tilde{\Psi}(p,t)$ given in [](#e-psix in psip), show that the above implies that the momentum wavefunction $\tilde\Psi(p,t)$ for a free particle is 
	 	$$ \tilde\Psi(p,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar}}c(p/\hbar)e^{-ip^2t/2M\hbar}$$
	 	\item Substitute $c(k)$ for a Gaussian wavepacket, given in [](#e-gaussian c(k)), into this expression, to reproduce [](#e-mom wf t gaussian).
