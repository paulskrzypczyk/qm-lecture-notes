In this unit you will learn all of the **basic ingredients** of quantum mechanics â€” the theory that describes the universe at the smallest scales. By now you will undoubtedly heard about many of the **iconic** and **counter-intuitive** aspects of quantum mechanics, including particles being in **superposition**, the **uncertainty principle**, **discrete energy levels**, to name just a few. The aim of this course is to give you your **first solid grounding** in all of these aspects, and many more. Since quantum mechanics is a **huge departure** from all the came before it, we will keep the scope of this unit small, and focus exclusively on the **mechanics of a single particle in one dimension**. As you will see, this nevertheless gives a rich playground to study almost all of the key features of quantum mechanics. 

As of **2023** I am trialing a HTML version of the lecture notes, which you are accessing here. If you spot any **typos** or **mistakes** which may have arisen from the conversion to HTML, **please let me know**, so that I can quickly fix them. 

If you prefer a more traditional PDF version of the lecture notes, for instance in order to annotate, then please see the lecture notes on Blackboard.
