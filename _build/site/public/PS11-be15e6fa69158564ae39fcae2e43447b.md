## Finite Square Well

1. In this question we will find the equation for the energy eigenvalues for the **symmetric** finite square well, i.e. the potential well such that
	\begin{equation*} V(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } -\frac{a}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{a}{2}, \\
		V_0 & \text{otherwise,}
	\end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
	where $V_0$ specifies the height of the well, and $a$ the width. We will denote the region to the left of the well, such that $x < -a/2$ by region I, the region inside the well, such that $-a/2 \leq x \leq a/2$ by region II, and the region to the right of the well, such that $x > a/2$ by region III. 
	
	We will only be interested in **bound** states, such that $E < V_0$. 
	
	Since the potential is now **symmetric** about the origin, it is an **even** function. This means that that the energy eigenstates will be alternatively **even** and **odd** functions. In this question we will only be interested in the energy eigenvalues of the **even** solutions, i.e. every other energy, starting with the ground state.

	1. Write down the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation in region I, and solve it, to show that the permissible solution in this region is
		\begin{equation*}
        u_\rI(x) = Ae^{\zeta x},
        \end{equation*} 
		where $\zeta = \sqrt{2M(V_0 - E)}/\hbar$ and $A$ is a constant.

	2. Write down the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation in region II, and solve it, to show that an **even** solution in this region is
		\begin{equation*}
        u_\rII(x) = C\cos kx,
        \end{equation*} 
		where $k = \sqrt{2ME}/\hbar$ and $C$ is a constant.

	3. Using the fact that the wavefunction is **even**, show that the solution in region III is
		\begin{equation*}
        u_\rIII(x) = Ae^{-\zeta x}.
        \end{equation*} 
		
	4. Use the continuity of the wavefunction and its first derivative at the boundary between regions I and II to show that the following equation must hold, which is the **quantisation condition**
	    \begin{equation*}
    \zeta = k \tan \frac{ka}{2}.
        \end{equation*}

	5. Defining $k_0 = \sqrt{2MV_0}/\hbar$, such that $\zeta^2 = k_0^2 - k^2$, find a suitable pair of functions to sketch, such that the intersection points of these functions give the allowed values of $k$. Make a sketch, and indicate the intersection points.
